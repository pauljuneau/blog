## Welcome to my blog! 

I like to write posts about things I am passionate about. You will probably find posts about opensource software and other inventions I am working on :-). 

In the footer of this page, and every page for that matter, you will see links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

You will find my opensource projects on my GitHub profile. Some of my projects will have discussions enabled, so please feel free to leave a post to let me know your thoughts! 

My professional portfolio is available on my LinkedIn profile. If you would like to send me a message, then please use LinkedIn.


Thanks for dropping by! I hope you enjoy my content!
